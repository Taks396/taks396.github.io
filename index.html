<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    All this page does is redirect to the homepage for organization purposes.
    Github Pages will only load a file called "index.html" not any others, so until I pay for my own site, this is my solution.
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=./HTML%20Files/Home.html" />
