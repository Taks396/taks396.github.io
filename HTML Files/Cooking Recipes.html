                <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
                <p>This won't be a long description I promise. This page exists to alphabettically list all of the recipes I have made ever since I started learning how to cook midway through college. I am not a <span title="Though my girlfriend thinks I am. Such lies.">chef,</span> but following these recipes at my altitude seems to work well.</p>
                <p>Also, I hate the spiel that most recipe sites put at the beginning of EVERY SINGLE recipe, so the links in the sidebar take you to the ingredients and instructions directly. You can read the background if you want, but thats not the goal.</p>
                <p>Finally, here's a quick list of some cooking terminology that I use but always found confusing, as well as some helpful tips:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Cutting:</b>
                        <ul class="terms">
                            <li><b>Whole: </b>Use the entire item of food. Might be useful for garlic, but I wouldn't know.</li>
                            <li>Crushed: Self explanitory. No cutting but crush the food item with whatever tool you have.</li>
                            <li>Sliced: Slices usually long and thin compared to the entire item. Garlic is like 2mm thin, onions closer to 5mm.</li>
                            <li>Fine/Minced: First slice, then cut the slices into tiny bits. Similar bit size as the slice width.</li>
                            <li>Paste/Pressed: This is kinda like crushing and mincing at the same time. You're trying to get the juice AND make fine bits.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li style="font-weight: bold;">To Taste: <span style="font-weight: normal;">I give you numbers for seasoning that I find tasty, but it might be strong or weak for anyone else. Get yourself a small fork or spoon and occasionally taste the food. If you're cooking for more than yourself, just rinse the taster or get another one.</span></li>
                    <li style="font-weight: bold;">
                        Temperature:
                        <ul style="font-weight: normal;">
                            <li>Speaking Range: low...medium...high</li>
                            <li>Numeric Range: 1-2...5-6...9-10</li>
                        </ul>
                        <span style="font-weight: normal;">Depending on your stove, these ranges could be accurate, or <span title="Bijous house has an electric stove similar to our college apartment and it cooks things at a much lower temperature than the apartment.">COMPLETELY WRONG</span>, so take this advice with a grain of salt.</span>

                    At home, my family never cooked alfredo pasta. Always spaghetti, which don't get me wrong tastes great, but never alfredo pasta. That was always reserved for going out to eat at resturaunts. In college, I wanted to change that, but since I was a poor college student, I couldn't exactly

                    often. Hence, homemade alfredo pasta!
                </p>

                <h3 id="alfredopasta">Alfredo Pasta: Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>

                    <li><b>1 Tbsp</b> Onion Powder</li>

                        <li><b>1/2 cups</b> Milk</li>
                        <li><b>1/2 cups</b> Heavy Whipping Cream</li>

                    <li><b>2 Tbsps</b> Finely Chopped Parsley</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This should serve 1-2 people if I did the math right. My original recipe is the same but the numbers are slightly bigger to account for some leftovers and the existance of Bijou.</p>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Boil noodles in a pot of water on high heat. Some sites will say boil before adding the noodles, but I find it doesn't matter as long as your checking how soft they are once it does start boiling. Drain the water once the noodles are <span title="Use a wooden spoon or something to grab a noodle and squish it a bit. Boil longer until satisfied. The box probably tells you how long it should take.">soft to your liking.</span></li>
                    <li>At the same time, heat your butter in a sauce pan over medium heat until it starts bubbling.</li>

If it starts rising, remove it from the heat quickly because clearly you weren't stirring enough!">Mix until simmering.</span></li>
                    <li>Reduce to low heat. Add the onion powder, salt, pepper, and parmesan cheese. Mix until the cheese melts and the sauce is a bit thicker than before.</li>
                    <li>Remove from heat and dump drained noodles into the sauce and mix. If your saucepan isnt big enough, pour the sauce and the noodles into a different bigger bowl.</li>
                    <li>Add parsely as garnish if you have it and serve.</li>

                <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Alfredo Pizza:</h2><br>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    So this one is funny. I made a deal with Bijou sometime near the end of college that if I could make a pizza, only then could I call myself a 
                    
                    <span title="I'm still not a chef, but don't tell Bijou that!">chef.</span> 
                    
                    Well that came back to bite me and I ended up making a really good alfredo pizza. Why alfredo? Dominos Pizza sells the best pizza in my opinion and my favorite from them is a three meat pizza with alfredo sauce instead of standard tomatoe sauce.
                </p>

                <h3 id="alfredopizza">Alfredo Pizza: Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><span title="You can make this yourself if you want, but you can just buy the right size ball from the grocery store."><b>1 ball</b> Pizza Dough</span></li>
                    <li><b>3/4 cups</b> <span title="I used the exact same sauce as in the alfredo pasta so click here to jump to that recipe."><a href="#alfredopasta">Alfredo Sauce</a></span></li>
                    <li><b>8oz</b> Low Moisture Mozzarella Cheese</li>
                    <li><b>1.5 Tbsps</b> <span title="You can also use green onions cut up into tiny pieces.">Sliced Chives</span></li>
                    <li><span title="Optional">Sliced Pepperoni</span></li>
                    <span title="I'm not putting amounts for these because they're very small and only relavent if you're using store bought dough.">
                        <li>Olive Oil and Flour</li>
                        <li>Salt to taste</li>
                    </span>
                </ul>

                <p>This will produce a pizza about the same size as a Dominos medium pizza and can be cut into 4-6 slices, but only feeds 2-3 people.</p>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Prepare your dough!</b> If you're making your own, you're on your own here. If you're using store bought dough, follow the instructions on the back to let the dough rise. Mine says to keep it out of the fridge for 4 hours, then let it sit in a light sprinkling of olive oil for 8 hours.</li>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 500F (260C). Roll your dough around in some flour then spread it over a pizza baking tray or a normal baking tray. <span title="If you struggle with this, that's ok. I did too and since I don't make this very often, I still do.">Keep enough dough near the edges to make a really flat bowl.</span></li>
                    <li>Add your <span title="If you made your own, you might want to cook this ahead of time to let it thicken while you work the dough.">homemade</span> or store bought alfredo sauce and evently spread over your dough bowl.</li>
                    <li>Pour on your mozzarella cheese and spread evenly. Lightly salt the pizza.</li>
                    <li><span title="You can skip this step if you want or substitute in any meat of your choosing.">Add a layer of pepperoni slices.</span></li>
                    <li>Move the pizza tray into the oven until the cheese is bubbling (10-15 minutes). Some ovens heat unevenly, so I rotate the pizza after about 8 minutes to try to keep the crust evenly cooked.</li>
                    <li>Remove from oven and add your <span title="Or green onion bits in my case">chives</span> as garnish.</li>
                    <li>This ones obvious, but cut it up into slices to serve each person 1-2 each. Enjoy!</li>

                <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Ketogenic Falafel</h2><br>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>There was a specific part of my colleges' cafeteria that served weird dishes meant to immitate food across the globe. One day, they served falafel with tzatziki sauce, and I wanted to make my own. The day I prepared to cook them, I learned that they take chickpeas and that said chickpeas need to soak in water overnight. I didn't have the time for that, so I found this recipe that uses almonds instead, and later learned it was ketogenic as a result. This recipe also makes a tahini sauce instead of <span title="And I have yet to try to make the tzatziki sauce because Bijous mom really likes this version.">tzatziki sauce</span> so I will list those ingredients and instructions seperately.</p>

                <h3 id="falafel">Ketogenic Falafel: Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>1 cup</b> Raw Almonds</li>
                    <li><b>1/4 cup</b> Hemp Hearts</li>
                    <li><b>2 Cloves</b> of Garlic</li>
                    <li><b>1 tsp</b> Ground Cumin</li>
                    <li><b>1 tsp</b> Chipotle Chili Powder</li>
                    <li><b>1/2 tsp</b> Onion Powder</li>
                    <li><b>1/2 tsp</b> Sea Salt</li>
                    <li><b>1 Egg</b></li>
                    <li><b>2 Tbsps</b> <span title="This stuff is not in fact an oil but a tough as hell paste that you need to rip apart with a spoon.">Refined Coconut Oil</span></li>
                    <li><b>1/2 cup</b> Finely Chopped Parsley</li>
                    <li><span title="Brushed or sprayed on, it doesnt matter.">Avocado Oil</span></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Tahini Sauce: Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>1/3 cup</b><span title="This is stuff is just sesame seed butter. Slightly goopier than peanut butter."> Tahini</span></li>
                    <li><b>1 Lemon</b> juiced</li>
                    <li><b>1 Tbsp</b> Agave Nectar</li>
                    <li><b>1 Tbsp</b> <span title="If you're using the spray option from above, just spray some into a Tbsp until you have enough.">Avocado Oil</span></li>
                </ul>

                <p>This will produce 12-16 ping-pong sized falafel and should feed 2 people without a side, 4 people with a seperately prepared side.</p>

                <h3>Main Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place almonds, hemp hearts, garlic, cumin, chili powder, onion powder, and sea salt into a food processor or blender. Food processors are better for mixing solid foods, but I don't own one, and you don't NEED one.</li>
                    <li>Process/Blend until ingredients are more or less a mixed powder. Should take 10-30 seconds. If you're using a blender like me, make sure to scrape the material off the sides and blend again to make sure the mix is even.</li>
                    <li>Add the egg, coconut oil and parsely and mix. Scrape the sides of the blender during this step as stuff absolutely will stick.</li>
                    <li>Chill the mixture in the fridge for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 350F (177C) and line a baking sheet with <span title="This is NOT WAX PAPER Bijou!">parchment paper.</span></li>
                    <li>Scoop 12-16 blobs of batter onto the baking sheet and <span title="Your hands will get oily here. It's not that big of a deal Bijou!">roll them into a ball.</span> Each should be about the size of a ping pong ball.</li>
                    <li>Bake them in the oven for 20 minutes and prepare your preferred sauce (see below for tahini sauce)</li>
                    <li>Spray some avocado oil onto the falafel and broil them on the top oven tray for 1-2 minutes until they look golden brown. Results may vary per oven so just watch them.</li>
                    <li>Serve alone or in wraps and enjoy!</li>
                </ol><br>

                <h3>Tahini Sauce</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Juice and de-seed your lemon into a medium bowl.</li>
                    <li>Add tahini paste, agave nectar and avocado oil and whisk until well mixed.</li>
                    <li>Optional: Add 2-4 Tbsps of water to thin it out, but I never do this because I like the dressing thick as is.</li>
                </ol><br>

                <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Stovetop Burgers:</h2><br>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    Again, my family rarely cooked burgers, and when we did they were awesome, so it annoyed me that we'd do it 
                    
                    <span title="Father also went on a diet so we couldn't eat a lot of foods like this, but that doesn't mean I wasn't disappointed!">so infrequently. </span>
                    
                    When I moved out for college, I wanted to change that, but also 
                    
                    <span title="One of my friends also set fire to the grill at my appartment well after I first made this recipe, further diswading me from using one.">didn't know how to use a grill. </span>

                    Therefore, stovetop cooked burgers! They end up tasting incredible, but I have never managed to not set off my smoke alarm. Be warned!
                </p>

                <h3 id="burger">Stovetop Burgers: Ingredients</h3>

                <p>I intentionally left very few quantities in the ingredients list because how many you make will change these quantities. In general, buying any package of those ingredients can create 4-8 burgers.</p>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prep your bun and toppings. Cut up your onion slices, apply condiments to the top and bottom buns, and have the cheese slices ready to put on the burgers while cooking. The burgers will come right off the pan and onto a bun, so you will want the toppings to be ready to assemble.</li>

                <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Tuna Melts</h2><br>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>The cafeteria at college served these tuna melts occasionally, but not often enough to me or Bijous liking. So one day, I wanted to challenge myself and make something similar at home. In the process, I found out that this recipe makes a tasty tuna salad if you don't want melts. I can't really say it's super healthy due to the mayonase, but it does contain a lot of balanced nutritional items.</p>

                <h3 id="tunamelt">Tuna Melt: Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>1/2 cup</b> Mayonnaise</li>
                    <li><b>1/2 Lemon</b> Juiced</li>
                    <li><b>1/2 Tbsp</b> Tahin</li>
                    <li title="Water based also works, but I generally buy 3x 4oz oil based tuna cans for this."><b>12oz</b> Oil Based Tuna</li>
                    <li><b>1 Celery Rib</b> Finely Chopped</li>
                    <li title="You can also use several dill pickle chips or a few spears if you have jarred pickles."><b>2 Dill Pickles</b> Finely Chopped</li>
                    <li title="I use white onions because I have those most often, but the recipe I used to learn how to do this says red. It's your choice."><b>1/4 cup</b> White or Red Onion</li>
                    <li><b>2 Tbsps</b> Finely Chopped Parsley</li>
                    <li>Salt & Pepper to taste</li>
                    <li><b>4 Tbsps</b> Salted or Unsalted Butter</li>
                    <li><b>8 Slices</b> of Bread</li>
                    <li><b>1 Tomatoe</b> Sliced</li>
                    <li><b>8 Slices</b> of Cheese</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Depending on your size of bread slices, this will make 4-6 tuna melt sandwiches. If you use smaller slices, you can also have some leftover tuna salad!</p>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl, whisk mayo, lemon juice (de-seeded) and tahin.</li>
                    <li>Drain the tuna and pull it apart using a fork before adding it to the bowl. You want the tuna to look kinda like pulled pork or finer.</li>
                    <li>Add celery, pickles, onion, and parsley to the bowl and evenly mix.</li>
                    <li>Season this mix with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                    <li>Spread 1/2 Tbsp on each slice of bread. These will be the OUTSIDE of the tuna melt.</li>
                    <li>Add a slice of cheese to the INSIDE of a slice of bread, a layer of tuna salad about half an inch thick, a tomatoe slice, another slice of cheese, and top the sandwich. Repeat for all remaining sandwiches.</li>
                    <li>Line a baking with aluminum foil and place all sandwhiches in the oven at 400F for 7-10 minutes or the bread is golden brown. You can try to flip them midway through, but I've never done this.</li>
                    <li>Serve with chips or the remaining tuna salad and enjoy!</li>
