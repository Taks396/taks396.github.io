            <p>
                This won't be a long description I promise. This page exists to alphabetically list all of the recipes I have made ever since I started learning how to cook midway through college. Each one is a dropdown so that you don't have to scroll too far to find the information you're looking for and don't have to look at information you don't need. I am not a 

                <span title="Though Bijou thinks I am. Such lies.">chef,</span>

                but following these recipes at my altitude seems to work well. Also, I hate the spiel that most recipe sites put at the beginning of EVERY SINGLE recipe, so the links in the sidebar take you to the ingredients and instructions directly. You can read the background of the recipes if you want, but since that's not the focus of this page, I've hidden them until you click on them.
            </p>

            <p>Finally, here's a quick list of some cooking terminology that I use but found confusing while I was learning, as well as some helpful tips:</p>

            <h4>Cutting:</h4>
            <ul class="terms">
                <li><b>Whole:</b> Use the entire item of food. Might be useful for garlic, but I wouldn't know.</li>
                <li><b>Crushed:</b> Self explanatory. No cutting but crush the food item with whatever tool you have.</li>
                <li><b>Sliced:</b> Slices usually long and thin compared to the entire item. Garlic is like 2mm thin, onions closer to 5mm.</li>
                <li><b>Fine/Minced:</b> First slice, then cut the slices into tiny bits. Similar bit size as the slice width.</li>
                <li><b>Paste/Pressed:</b> This is kinda like crushing and mincing at the same time. You're trying to get the juice AND make fine bits.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b><u>To Taste:</u></b> I give you numbers for seasoning that I find tasty, but it might be strong or weak for anyone else. Get yourself a small fork or spoon and occasionally taste the food. If you're cooking for more than yourself, just rinse the utensil.</p>

            <p>
                <b><u>Temperature:</u></b> Depending on your stove, these ranges could be accurate, or 

                <span title="Bijous house has an electric stove similar to our college apartment and it cooks things at a much lower temperature than the apartment.">COMPLETELY WRONG</span>, 

                so take this advice with a grain of salt:
            </p>
            <ul class="terms">
                <li><b>Word Range:</b> low ... medium ... high</li>
                <li><b>Numeric Range:</b> 1-2 ... 5-6 ... 9-10</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Alfredo Pasta</h2>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                At home, my family never cooked alfredo pasta. Always spaghetti, which don't get me wrong tastes great, but never alfredo pasta. That was always reserved for going out to eat at resturaunts. In college, I wanted to change that, but since I was a poor college student, I couldn't exactly

                <span title="Olive garden serves the best alfredo pasta. Fight me!">go out to eat</span>

                often. Hence, homemade alfredo pasta!
            </p>

            <h3 id="alfredopasta">Alfredo Pasta: Ingredients</h3>
            <ul class="items">
                <li><span title="Literally you can use any noodles."><b>4oz</b> Pasta Noodles</span></li>
                <li><span title="Salted or unsalted it doesn't matter."><b>1 Tbsp</b> Butter</span></li>
                <li><b>2 cloves</b> Minced Garlic</span> or <b>2-3 Tbsps</b> Garlic Powder</span></li>
                <li><b>1 Tbsp</b> Onion Powder</li>
                <span title="I found half milk and half cream works better than the 3:2 ratio many recipes suggest.">
                    <li><b>1/2 cups</b> Milk</li>
                    <li><b>1/2 cups</b> Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
                </span>
                <li><b>1 cup</b> Parmesan Cheese</li>
                <span title="I tend to just eyeball it but see my note in the description about 'To Taste.'">
                    <li><b>1/4 tsp</b> Salt or to taste</li>
                    <li><b>1/4 tsp</b> Pepper or to taste</li>
                </span>
                <li><b>2 Tbsps</b> Finely Chopped Parsley</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This should serve 1-2 people if I did the math right. My original recipe is the same but the numbers are slightly bigger to account for some leftovers and the existence of Bijou.</p>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol class="items">
                <li>
                    Boil noodles in a pot of water on high heat. Some sites will say boil before adding the noodles, but I find it doesn't matter as long as your checking how soft they are once it does start boiling. Drain the water once the noodles are

                </li>
                <li>At the same time, heat your butter in a sauce pan over medium heat until it starts bubbling.</li>
                <li>
                    <span title="If your using garlic powder, wait until the next step to add that.">Add the minced garlic</span> 
                    to the bubbly butter and mix around until golden brown or it smells garlicy. Should be about 30 seconds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add milk and cream into the saucepan. If you didnt add garlic earlier, add your garlic powder now. 
                    <span title="Bubbling but not bubbling heavily. If it starts rising, remove it from the heat quickly because clearly you weren't stirring enough!">Mix until simmering.</span>
                </li>
                <li>Reduce to low heat. Add the onion powder, salt, pepper, and parmesan cheese. Mix until the cheese melts and the sauce is a bit thicker than before.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat and dump drained noodles into the sauce and mix. If your saucepan isn't big enough, pour the sauce and the noodles into a different bigger bowl.</li>
                <li>Add parsley as garnish if you have it and serve.</li>
            </ol>
