            <p>
                This won't be a long description I promise. This page exists to alphabetically list all of the recipes I have made ever since I started learning how to cook midway through college. Each one is a dropdown so that you don't have to scroll too far to find the information you're looking for and don't have to look at information you don't need. I am not a 

                <span title="Though Bijou thinks I am. Such lies.">chef,</span>

                but following these recipes at my altitude seems to work well. Also, I hate the spiel that most recipe sites put at the beginning of EVERY SINGLE recipe, so the links in the sidebar take you to the ingredients and instructions directly. You can read the background of the recipes if you want, but since that's not the focus of this page, I've hidden them until you click on them.
            </p>

            <p>Finally, here's a quick list of some cooking terminology that I use but found confusing while I was learning, as well as some helpful tips:</p>

            <h4>Cutting:</h4>
            <ul class="terms">
                <li><b>Whole:</b> Use the entire item of food. Might be useful for garlic, but I wouldn't know.</li>
                <li><b>Crushed:</b> Self explanatory. No cutting but crush the food item with whatever tool you have.</li>
                <li><b>Sliced:</b> Slices usually long and thin compared to the entire item. Garlic is like 2mm thin, onions closer to 5mm.</li>
                <li><b>Fine/Minced:</b> First slice, then cut the slices into tiny bits. Similar bit size as the slice width.</li>
                <li><b>Paste/Pressed:</b> This is kinda like crushing and mincing at the same time. You're trying to get the juice AND make fine bits.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b><u>To Taste:</u></b> I give you numbers for seasoning that I find tasty, but it might be strong or weak for anyone else. Get yourself a small fork or spoon and occasionally taste the food. If you're cooking for more than yourself, just rinse the utensil.</p>

            <p>
                <b><u>Temperature:</u></b> Depending on your stove, these ranges could be accurate, or 

                <span title="Bijous house has an electric stove similar to our college apartment and it cooks things at a much lower temperature than the apartment.">COMPLETELY WRONG</span>, 

                so take this advice with a grain of salt:
            </p>
            <ul class="terms">
                <li><b>Word Range:</b> low ... medium ... high</li>
                <li><b>Numeric Range:</b> 1-2 ... 5-6 ... 9-10</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Alfredo Pasta</h2>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                At home, my family never cooked alfredo pasta. Always spaghetti, which don't get me wrong tastes great, but never alfredo pasta. That was always reserved for going out to eat at resturaunts. In college, I wanted to change that, but since I was a poor college student, I couldn't exactly

                <span title="Olive garden serves the best alfredo pasta. Fight me!">go out to eat</span>

                often. Hence, homemade alfredo pasta!

            </ul>

            <p>This should serve 1-2 people if I did the math right. My original recipe is the same but the numbers are slightly bigger to account for some leftovers and the existence of Bijou.</p>

            <h2>Alfredo Pizza</h2>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                So this one is funny. I made a deal with Bijou sometime near the end of college that if I could make a pizza, only then could I call myself a 

                <span title="I'm still not a chef, but don't tell Bijou that!">chef.</span> 

                Well that came back to bite me and I ended up making a really good alfredo pizza. Why alfredo? Dominos Pizza sells the best pizza in my opinion and my favorite from them is a three meat pizza with alfredo sauce instead of standard tomatoe sauce.
            </p>

            <h3 id="alfredopizza">Alfredo Pizza: Ingredients</h3>
            <ul class="items">
                <li><span title="You can make this yourself if you want, but you can just buy the right size ball from the grocery store."><b>1 ball</b> Pizza Dough</span></li>
                <li><b>3/4 cups</b> <span title="I used the exact same sauce as in the alfredo pasta so click here to jump to that recipe."><a href="#alfredopasta">Alfredo Sauce</a></span></li>

                <li><b>1.5 Tbsps</b> <span title="You can also use green onions cut up into tiny pieces.">Sliced Chives</span></li>
                <li><span title="Optional">Sliced Pepperoni</span></li>
                <span title="I'm not putting amounts for these because they're very small and only relavent if you're using store bought dough.">
                    <li>Olive Oil and Flour</li>
                    <li>Salt to taste</li>
                </span>
            </ul>

            <p>This will produce a pizza about the same size as a Dominos medium pizza and can be cut into 4-6 slices, but only feeds 2-3 people.</p>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol class="items">
                <li><b>Prepare your dough!</b> If you're making your own, you're on your own here. If you're using store bought dough, follow the instructions on the back to let the dough rise. Mine says to keep it out of the fridge for 4 hours, then let it sit in a light sprinkling of olive oil for 8 hours.</li>
                <li>
                    Preheat oven to 500F (260C). Roll your dough around in some flour then spread it over a pizza baking tray or a normal baking tray. 
                    <span title="If you struggle with this, that's ok. I did too and since I don't make this very often, I still do.">Keep enough dough near the edges to make a really flat bowl.</span>

                    or store bought alfredo sauce and evently spread over your dough bowl.
                </li>
                <li>Pour on your mozzarella cheese and spread evenly. Lightly salt the pizza.</li>
                <li><span title="You can skip this step if you want or substitute in any meat of your choosing.">Add a layer of pepperoni slices.</span></li>
                <li>Move the pizza tray into the oven until the cheese is bubbling (10-15 minutes). Some ovens heat unevenly, so I rotate the pizza after about 8 minutes to try to keep the crust evenly cooked.</li>
                <li>
                    Remove from oven and add your 
                    <span title="Or green onion bits in my case">chives</span> 
                    as garnish.</li>
                <li>This ones obvious, but cut it up into slices to serve each person 1-2 each. Enjoy!</li>

            <h2>Ground Beef Curry</h2>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>When I made this recipe, I didn't want to learn how to cook chicken and pork almost always tastes dry to me. Bijous mom also told me one day she really likes Indian food, so I wanted to try to make a curry for them. This is why I went with ground beef curry, even though using anything beef in Indian food is wrong. Being not-indian, I don't care and think this recipe tastes great.</p>

            <ul class="items">
                <li><b>1 lb</b> Ground Beef</li>

                <li><b>2 cups</b> White Rice</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This should produce enough for 4-6 people depending on whether Bijous mom wants seconds.</p>

                </li>

                <li>While the curry itself is boiling, boil two cups of water and two cups of minute white rice. I did this in the same pot as I prepared the chicken broth, so my rice got flavor infused.</li>

            <p>
                There was a specific part of my colleges' cafeteria that served weird dishes meant to immitate food across the globe. One day, they served falafel with tzatziki sauce, and I wanted to make my own. The day I prepared to cook them, I learned that they take chickpeas and that said chickpeas need to soak in water overnight. I didn't have the time for that, so I found this recipe that uses almonds instead, and later learned it was ketogenic as a result. This recipe also makes a tahini sauce instead of

            <p>This will produce 12-16 ping-pong sized falafel and should feed 2 people without a side, 4 people with a seperately prepared side.</p>

            <h3>Main Instructions</h3>
            <ol class="items">
                <li>Place almonds, hemp hearts, garlic, cumin, chili powder, onion powder, and sea salt into a food processor or blender. Food processors are better for mixing solid foods, but I don't own one, and you don't NEED one.</li>
                <li>Process/Blend until ingredients are more or less a mixed powder. Should take 10-30 seconds. If you're using a blender like me, make sure to scrape the material off the sides and blend again to make sure the mix is even.</li>
                <li>Add the egg, coconut oil and parsely and mix. Scrape the sides of the blender during this step as stuff absolutely will stick.</li>
                <li>Chill the mixture in the fridge for 30 minutes.</li>

                    Each should be about the size of a ping pong ball.
                </li>
                <li>Bake them in the oven for 20 minutes and prepare your preferred sauce (see below for tahini sauce)</li>
                <li>Spray some avocado oil onto the falafel and broil them on the top oven tray for 1-2 minutes until they look golden brown. Results may vary per oven so just watch them.</li>
                <li>Serve alone or in wraps and enjoy!</li>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                For as long as I can remember, I have eaten a really unhealthy breakfast consisting of a 

                <span title="I know, how spoiled am I. Sue me.">spoonful of peanut butter and chocolate teddy grahams.</span> 

                I stopped doing that when I moved out to college, but when I would come back during summers, I would still see some pretty old peanut butter in the house. I would eat PB&Js occasionally, but to my knowledge, my family doesn't eat peanut butter due to my fathers ketogenic diet. I wanted to figure out how to use it, so I decided to make cookies out of it for Bijou and her family. Believe it or not, peanut butter doesn't go bad fast at all.

            <h3 id="pbcookie">Peanut Butter Cookies: Ingredients</h3>
            <ul class="items">
                <li><b>1 1/2 cups</b> Flour</li>
                <li><span title="This is a lot more than you think"><b>1 cup</b></span> Creamy Peanut Butter</li>
                <li><span title="Also called a stick of butter."><b>1/2 cup</b></span> Unsalted Butter</li>
                <li><b>1/2 cup</b> Brown Sugar</li>
                <li><b>1/2 cup</b> Sugar</li>
                <li><b>1 tsp</b> Vanilla Extract</li>
                <li><b>1 Egg</b></li>
                <li><b>3/4 tsp</b> Baking Powder</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This should produce 15-18 cookies depending on how large you roll them before baking. The suggested size is 1 inch balls, but my baking tray wasnt big enough to store that many at once.</p>
