            <p>
                This won't be a long description I promise. This page exists to alphabetically list all of the recipes I have made ever since I started learning how to cook midway through college. Each one is a dropdown so that you don't have to scroll too far to find the information you're looking for and don't have to look at information you don't need. I am not a 

                <span title="Though Bijou thinks I am. Such lies.">chef,</span>

                but following these recipes at my altitude seems to work well. Also, I hate the spiel that most recipe sites put at the beginning of EVERY SINGLE recipe, so the links in the sidebar take you to the ingredients and instructions directly. You can read the background of the recipes if you want, but since that's not the focus of this page, I've hidden them until you click on them.
            </p>

            <p>Finally, here's a quick list of some cooking terminology that I use but found confusing while I was learning, as well as some helpful tips:</p>

            <h4>Cutting:</h4>
            <ul class="terms">
                <li><b>Whole:</b> Use the entire item of food. Might be useful for garlic, but I wouldn't know.</li>
                <li><b>Crushed:</b> Self explanatory. No cutting but crush the food item with whatever tool you have.</li>
                <li><b>Sliced:</b> Slices usually long and thin compared to the entire item. Garlic is like 2mm thin, onions closer to 5mm.</li>
                <li><b>Fine/Minced:</b> First slice, then cut the slices into tiny bits. Similar bit size as the slice width.</li>
                <li><b>Paste/Pressed:</b> This is kinda like crushing and mincing at the same time. You're trying to get the juice AND make fine bits.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b><u>To Taste:</u></b> I give you numbers for seasoning that I find tasty, but it might be strong or weak for anyone else. Get yourself a small fork or spoon and occasionally taste the food. If you're cooking for more than yourself, just rinse the utensil.</p>

            <p>
                <b><u>Temperature:</u></b> Depending on your stove, these ranges could be accurate, or 

                <span title="Bijous house has an electric stove similar to our college apartment and it cooks things at a much lower temperature than the apartment.">COMPLETELY WRONG</span>, 

                so take this advice with a grain of salt:
            </p>
            <ul class="terms">
                <li><b>Word Range:</b> low ... medium ... high</li>
                <li><b>Numeric Range:</b> 1-2 ... 5-6 ... 9-10</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Alfredo Pasta</h2>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                At home, my family never cooked alfredo pasta. Always spaghetti, which don't get me wrong tastes great, but never alfredo pasta. That was always reserved for going out to eat at resturaunts. In college, I wanted to change that, but since I was a poor college student, I couldn't exactly

                <span title="Olive garden serves the best alfredo pasta. Fight me!">go out to eat</span>

                often. Hence, homemade alfredo pasta!
            </p>

                <li><b>2 cloves</b> Minced Garlic</span> or <b>2-3 Tbsps</b> Garlic Powder</span></li>
                <li><b>1 Tbsp</b> Onion Powder</li>
                <span title="I found half milk and half cream works better than the 3:2 ratio many recipes suggest.">

                <li><b>2 Tbsps</b> Finely Chopped Parsley</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This should serve 1-2 people if I did the math right. My original recipe is the same but the numbers are slightly bigger to account for some leftovers and the existence of Bijou.</p>

                    Boil noodles in a pot of water on high heat. Some sites will say boil before adding the noodles, but I find it doesn't matter as long as your checking how soft they are once it does start boiling. Drain the water once the noodles are

                <li>
                    Add milk and cream into the saucepan. If you didnt add garlic earlier, add your garlic powder now.

                </li>
                <li>Reduce to low heat. Add the onion powder, salt, pepper, and parmesan cheese. Mix until the cheese melts and the sauce is a bit thicker than before.</li>
                <li>Remove from heat and dump drained noodles into the sauce and mix. If your saucepan isn't big enough, pour the sauce and the noodles into a different bigger bowl.</li>
                <li>Add parsley as garnish if you have it and serve.</li>

            <h2>Alfredo Pizza</h2>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                So this one is funny. I made a deal with Bijou sometime near the end of college that if I could make a pizza, only then could I call myself a 

                <span title="I'm still not a chef, but don't tell Bijou that!">chef.</span> 

                Well that came back to bite me and I ended up making a really good alfredo pizza. Why alfredo? Dominos Pizza sells the best pizza in my opinion and my favorite from them is a three meat pizza with alfredo sauce instead of standard tomatoe sauce.
            </p>

            <h3 id="alfredopizza">Alfredo Pizza: Ingredients</h3>
            <ul class="items">
                <li><span title="You can make this yourself if you want, but you can just buy the right size ball from the grocery store."><b>1 ball</b> Pizza Dough</span></li>
                <li><b>3/4 cups</b> <span title="I used the exact same sauce as in the alfredo pasta so click here to jump to that recipe."><a href="#alfredopasta">Alfredo Sauce</a></span></li>
                <li><b>8oz</b> Low Moisture Mozzarella Cheese</li>
                <li><b>1.5 Tbsps</b> <span title="You can also use green onions cut up into tiny pieces.">Sliced Chives</span></li>
                <li><span title="Optional">Sliced Pepperoni</span></li>
                <span title="I'm not putting amounts for these because they're very small and only relavent if you're using store bought dough.">
                    <li>Olive Oil and Flour</li>
                    <li>Salt to taste</li>
                </span>
            </ul>

            <p>This will produce a pizza about the same size as a Dominos medium pizza and can be cut into 4-6 slices, but only feeds 2-3 people.</p>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol class="items">
                <li><b>Prepare your dough!</b> If you're making your own, you're on your own here. If you're using store bought dough, follow the instructions on the back to let the dough rise. Mine says to keep it out of the fridge for 4 hours, then let it sit in a light sprinkling of olive oil for 8 hours.</li>
                <li>
                    Preheat oven to 500F (260C). Roll your dough around in some flour then spread it over a pizza baking tray or a normal baking tray. 
                    <span title="If you struggle with this, that's ok. I did too and since I don't make this very often, I still do.">Keep enough dough near the edges to make a really flat bowl.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add your

                    or store bought alfredo sauce and evently spread over your dough bowl.
                </li>
                <li>Pour on your mozzarella cheese and spread evenly. Lightly salt the pizza.</li>
                <li><span title="You can skip this step if you want or substitute in any meat of your choosing.">Add a layer of pepperoni slices.</span></li>
                <li>Move the pizza tray into the oven until the cheese is bubbling (10-15 minutes). Some ovens heat unevenly, so I rotate the pizza after about 8 minutes to try to keep the crust evenly cooked.</li>
                <li>
                    Remove from oven and add your 
                    <span title="Or green onion bits in my case">chives</span> 
                    as garnish.</li>
                <li>This ones obvious, but cut it up into slices to serve each person 1-2 each. Enjoy!</li>

            <h2>Ground Beef Curry</h2>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>When I made this recipe, I didn't want to learn how to cook chicken and pork almost always tastes dry to me. Bijous mom also told me one day she really likes Indian food, so I wanted to try to make a curry for them. This is why I went with ground beef curry, even though using anything beef in Indian food is wrong. Being not-indian, I don't care and think this recipe tastes great.</p>

            <h3 id="grndbfcurry">Ground Beef Curry: Ingredients</h3>
            <ul class="items">
                <li><b>1 lb</b> Ground Beef</li>
                <li><b>1 Onion</b> Chopped</li>
                <li><b>2 Tbsps</b> Olive Oil</li>
                <li><b>1 clove</b> Minced Garlic</li>
                <li><span title="Saw off a chunk of ginger about the same size as the garlic."><b>1 Tbsp</b></span> Ginger Grated</li>
                <li><span title="The smallest amount I can find in stores is like 5..."><b>2 Tbsps</b></span> Tomatoe Paste</li>
                <li><b>2 Tbsps</b> Curry Powder</li>
                <li><b>1 1/2 tsp</b> Cayenne or Paprika Powder</li>
                <li><span title="This is spice. No idea how it helps the taste honestly."><b>1 tsp</b>  Garam Masala</span></li>
                <li><span title="You can use any milk here honestly."><b>1/2 cup</b> Coconut Milk</span></li>
                <li><b>1 cup</b> Chicken Broth</li>
                <li><b>1 tsp</b> Salt & Pepper</li>
                <li><b>2 Tbsps</b> Lemmon Juice</li>
                <li><b>2 cups</b> White Rice</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This should produce enough for 4-6 people depending on whether Bijous mom wants seconds.</p>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol class="items">
                <li><b>Prepare your ingredients!</b> Seriously, you add stuff to the pan very quickly so you don't have time to prep in between. This includes the chicken broth if you have to make it seperately.</li>
                <li>Add cooking oil to a wide and deep pan on medium high heat.</li>
                <li>Once oil starts to smoke or bubble, add onion and saute until they are translucent and soft.</li>
                <li>Add ginger and garlic and saute for 1-2 minutes.</li>
                <li>
                    Add tomatoe paste and 
                    <span title="I mix all the spices together in a cup beforehand.">all spices.</span>
                </li>
                <li>Add coconut milk, chicken broth, and lemon juice. Bring to a boil and boil for 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>While the curry itself is boiling, boil two cups of water and two cups of minute white rice. I did this in the same pot as I prepared the chicken broth, so my rice got flavor infused.</li>
                <li>Layer curry on top of rice and serve.</li>
