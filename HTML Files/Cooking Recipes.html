            <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
            <p>
                This won't be a long description I promise. This page exists to alphabetically list all of the recipes I have made ever since I started learning how to cook midway through college. Each one is a dropdown so that you don't have to scroll too far to find the information you're looking for and don't have to look at information you don't need. I am not a chef, as much as Bijou thinks I am, but I have found these recipes to be consistently tasty when I make them. Also, I hate the spiel that most recipe sites put at the beginning of EVERY SINGLE recipe, so the links in the sidebar take you to the ingredients and instructions directly. You can read the background of the recipes if you want, but since that's not the focus of this page, I've hidden them until you click on them.
            </p>

            <p>Finally, here's a quick list, in no particular order, of some cooking terminology that I use but found confusing while I was learning, as well as some helpful tips:</p>

            <h4>Cutting:</h4>
            <ul class="terms">
                <li title="Might be useful for garlic, but I wouldn't know."><b>Whole:</b> Use the entire item of food, except the inedible parts like onion skin.</li>
                <li><b>Crushed:</b> Self explanatory. No cutting but crush the food item with a mallet or the side of a knife.</li>
                <li><b>Sliced:</b> Slices usually long and thin compared to the entire item. Garlic is like 2mm thin, onions closer to 7mm.</li>
                <li><b>Fine/Minced:</b> First slice, then cut the slices into tiny bits. Similar bit size as the slice width.</li>
                <li><b>Paste/Pressed:</b> This is kinda like crushing and mincing at the same time. You're trying to get the juice AND make fine bits.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b><u>To Taste:</u></b> I give you values for most of the seasoning I use, but sometimes I don't because the value would be really small, or I personally find the value 
                
                <span title="Fight me Bijou! Your lack of hydration completely screws how consistent your sense of taste is!">doesn't impact the consistency of the taste.</span> 
                
                I suggest you get yourself a small fork or spoon and occasionally taste the food. If you're cooking for more than yourself, just rinse the utensil.</p>

            <p>
                <b><u>Temperature:</u></b> Depending on your stove, these ranges could be accurate, or 

                <span title="Bijous house has an electric stove similar to our college apartment and it cooks things at a much lower temperature than the apartment.">COMPLETELY WRONG</span>, 

                so take this advice with a grain of salt:
            </p>
            <ul class="terms" title="In Bijous house, this is closer to LOW ... MEDIUM | 1-5 ... 6-10">
                <li><b>Word Range:</b> LOW ... MEDIUM ... HIGH</li>
                <li><b>Numeric Range:</b> 1-2 ... 5-6 ... 9-10</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <b><u>Expiration Dates:</u></b> Check these when you're making any meals. Personally, I don't do this because 
                
                <span title="Tested and proven">I have a gut of steel,</span>

                but after having 

                <span title="Not really! Relax, she just had stomach problems for a day or two!">nearly killed Bijou</span> 

                by cooking with expired products, I have been more mindful of those dates when I cook for other people. Heed my warning.
            </p>

            <p><b><u>Cooking Environment:</u></b> I cannot tell you how to cook according to where you live. I live at a high elevation and humidity varies wildly here which changes my results compared to someone at sea level. I also don't travel, so I have no idea how to cook when the environment is vastly different. For standard cooking, this shouldn't matter as long as you just check the food and adjust your temperature and time accordingly, but with baking, the best advice I can give is to find a religion and start praying to a god that will smite both you and your first born.</p>

                        At home, my family never cooked alfredo pasta. Always spaghetti. Don't get me wrong, I like that spaghetti, but I LOVE the taste of alfredo, and only ever got it at restaurants. In college, I wanted to change that, but since I was a poor college student, I couldn't exactly

                        often. Hence, homemade alfredo pasta!

                    <p>
                        So this one is funny. I made a deal with Bijou sometime near the end of college that if I could make a pizza, only then could I call myself a 

                        <span title="I'm not, but don't tell Bijou that!">chef.</span> 

                        Well that came back to bite me and I ended up making a really good alfredo pizza. Why alfredo? Dominos Pizza sells the best pizza in my opinion and my favorite from them is a three meat pizza with alfredo sauce instead of standard tomato sauce.
                    </p>

                <p>This will produce a 10-12 inch pizza and only feeds 2-3 people in my experience.</p>

                    <li>Move the pizza tray into the oven until the cheese is bubbling (10-15 minutes). Some ovens heat unevenly, so I rotate the pizza after about 8 minutes to try to keep the crust evenly cooked.</li>

                    <p>
                        The motivation behind this recipe was extremely simple: I saw a few instagram reels saying you could make a chocolate mousse with hard boiled eggs and thought "Thats dumb, lets try it." Now, some of you, mostly Bijou, will look at this recipe and think, "Hol' up, that's a chocolate pudding, not a mousse! You lied to me Taks!" You are in fact mistaken. The recipe I used CLEARLY says that this is a mousse, 
                        <span title="Look, I know it's not actually a mousse, I'm just messing with Bijou. Don't @ me.">so therefore it must be a mousse.</span>
                    </p>
                </details>

                <h3 id="chocmousse">Chocolate Mousse: Ingredients</h3>
                <ul class="items">
                    <li><b>8 Eggs</b> Hard boiled</li>
                    <li title="You can use pretty much any milk you want. 2%, coconut, almond, or none at all. I forgot when I made mine."><b>1 Cup</b> Milk</li>
                    <li title="Or more if you want. You also can use any chocolate powder. I used Swiss Mix the first time."><b>4 Tbsp</b> Cocoa Powder</li>
                    <li><b>1 tsp</b> Vanilla Extract</li>
                    <li><b>1/2 Cup</b> Maple Syrup</li>
                    <li><b>1/2 Cup</b> Chocolate Chips</li>
                    <li><b>1/2 Cup</b> Nutella</li>
                    <li><b>1 tsp</b> Salt</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This will produce about 40-50oz of chocolate mousse which I served in glasses that look like they are twice the size of a shot glass. It made three of those glasses worth, but I don't actually know the amount, so I'm just estimating here.</p>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol class="items">
                    <li>Place your eggs in enough water to cover them and bring to a boil.</li>
                    <li>Once boiling, remove them from the heat and cover for 9-12 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Place the eggs in an ice bath for 5-10 minutes, then peel them.</li>
                    <li>Place the peeled eggs and remaining ingredients in a blender and mix until combined, scraping the sides occasionally to prevent clumps from not mixing.</li>
                    <li>Add other ingredients like more cocoa powder, other types of chocolate, cookie pieces, and more as you see fit. This is really an extremely sweet trash can style of recipe.</li>

                        There was a specific part of my colleges' cafeteria that served weird dishes meant to imitate food across the globe. One day, they served falafel with tzatziki sauce, and I wanted to make my own. The day I prepared to cook them, I learned that they take chickpeas which need to soak in water overnight. I didn't have the time for that, so I found this recipe that uses almonds instead, and later learned it was ketogenic as a result. This recipe also makes a tahini sauce instead of 

                        <span title="And I have yet to try to make the tzatziki sauce because Bijous mom really likes this version.">tzatziki sauce</span>

                    <li><b>1 Egg</b></li>
                    <li title="This stuff is not in fact an oil but a tough as hell paste that you need to rip apart with a spoon."><b>2 Tbsps</b> Refined Coconut Oil</li>

                    <li title="Brushed or sprayed on, it doesn't matter."> Avocado Oil</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Tahini Sauce: Ingredients</h3>
                <ul class="items">
                    <li><b>1/3 Cup</b><span title="This is stuff is just sesame seed butter. Slightly gooier than peanut butter."> Tahini</span></li>
                    <li><b>1 Lemon</b> juiced</li>

                </ul>

                <p>This will produce 12-16 ping-pong sized falafel and should feed 2 people without a side, 4 people with a separately prepared side.</p>

                <h3>Main Instructions</h3>
                <ol class="items">
                    <li>Place almonds, hemp hearts, garlic, cumin, chili powder, onion powder, and sea salt into a food processor or blender. Food processors are better for mixing solid foods, but I don't own one, and you don't NEED one.</li>
                    <li>Process/Blend until ingredients are more or less a mixed powder. Should take 10-30 seconds. If you're using a blender like me, make sure to scrape the material off the sides and blend again to make sure the mix is even.</li>
                    <li>Add the egg, coconut oil and parsley and mix. Scrape the sides of the blender during this step as stuff absolutely will stick.</li>
                    <li>Chill the mixture in the fridge for 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>
                        Preheat the oven to 350F (177C) and line a baking sheet with

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Scoop 12-16 blobs of batter onto the baking sheet and 

                        <span title="Your hands will get oily here. It's not that big of a deal Bijou!">roll them into a ball.</span> 

                        Each should be about the size of a ping pong ball.
                    </li>
                    <li>Bake them in the oven for 20 minutes and prepare your preferred sauce (see below for tahini sauce)</li>
                    <li>Spray some avocado oil onto the falafel and broil them on the top oven tray for 1-2 minutes until they look golden brown. Results may vary per oven so just watch them.</li>
                    <li>Serve alone or in wraps and enjoy!</li>

                    <li>Juice and de-seed your lemon into a medium bowl.</li>
                    <li>Add tahini paste, agave nectar and avocado oil and whisk until well mixed.</li>
                    <li>Optional: Add 2-4 Tbsps of water to thin it out, but I never do this because I like the dressing thick as is.</li>

                    <p>
                        For as long as I can remember, I have eaten a really unhealthy breakfast consisting of a 

                        <span title="I know, how spoiled am I. Sue me.">spoonful of peanut butter and chocolate teddy grahams.</span> 

                        I stopped doing that when I moved out to college, but when I would come back during summers, I would still see some pretty old peanut butter in the house. I would eat PB&Js occasionally, but to my knowledge, my family doesn't eat peanut butter due to my fathers ketogenic diet. I wanted to figure out how to use it, so I decided to make cookies out of it for Bijou and her family. Believe it or not, peanut butter doesn't go bad fast at all.
                    </p>
                </details>

                <h3 id="pbcookie">Peanut Butter Cookies: Ingredients</h3>
                <ul class="items">
                    <li><b>1 1/2 cups</b> Flour</li>
                    <li title="This is a lot more than you think"><b>1 Cup</b> Creamy Peanut Butter</li>

                    <li><b>3/4 Tsp</b> Baking Powder</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This should produce 15-18 cookies depending on how large you roll them before baking. The suggested size is 1 inch balls, but my baking tray wasn't big enough to store that many at once.</p>

                    <li>
                        Roll dough into

                    <li>Bake for 10-15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Pull them out and let them sit for another 10-15 minutes. They will be soft so this gives them time to finish baking and harden.</li>

                    <p>The cafeteria at college served tuna melts occasionally, but not often enough to me or Bijous liking. So one day, I wanted to challenge myself and make something similar at home. In the process, I found out that this recipe makes a tasty tuna salad if you don't want melts. I can't really say it's super healthy due to the mayonnaise, but it does contain a lot of balanced nutritional items.</p>

                    <li>Spread 1/2 Tbsp on each slice of bread. These will be the OUTSIDE of the tuna melt.</li>
                    <li>Add a slice of cheese to the INSIDE of a slice of bread, a layer of tuna salad about half an inch thick, a tomato slice, another slice of cheese, and top the sandwich. Repeat for all remaining sandwiches.</li>
                    <li>Line a baking with aluminum foil and place all sandwiches in the oven at 400F for 7-10 minutes or the bread is golden brown. You can try to flip them midway through, but I've never done this.</li>
