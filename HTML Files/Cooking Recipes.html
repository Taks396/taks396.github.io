                This won't be a long description I promise. This page exists to alphabetically list all of the recipes I have made ever since I started learning how to cook midway through college. Each one is a dropdown so that you don't have to scroll too far to find the information you're looking for and don't have to look at information you don't need. I am not a 

                <span title="Though Bijou thinks I am. Such lies.">chef,</span>

                but following these recipes at my altitude seems to work well. Also, I hate the spiel that most recipe sites put at the beginning of EVERY SINGLE recipe, so the links in the sidebar take you to the ingredients and instructions directly. You can read the background of the recipes if you want, but since that's not the focus of this page, I've hidden them until you click on them.
            </p>

            <p>Finally, here's a quick list of some cooking terminology that I use but found confusing while I was learning, as well as some helpful tips:</p>

            <h4>Cutting:</h4>
            <ul class="terms">
                <li><b>Whole:</b> Use the entire item of food. Might be useful for garlic, but I wouldn't know.</li>
                <li><b>Crushed:</b> Self explanatory. No cutting but crush the food item with whatever tool you have.</li>
                <li><b>Sliced:</b> Slices usually long and thin compared to the entire item. Garlic is like 2mm thin, onions closer to 5mm.</li>
                <li><b>Fine/Minced:</b> First slice, then cut the slices into tiny bits. Similar bit size as the slice width.</li>
                <li><b>Paste/Pressed:</b> This is kinda like crushing and mincing at the same time. You're trying to get the juice AND make fine bits.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b><u>To Taste:</u></b> I give you numbers for seasoning that I find tasty, but it might be strong or weak for anyone else. Get yourself a small fork or spoon and occasionally taste the food. If you're cooking for more than yourself, just rinse the utensil.</p>

            <p>
                <b><u>Temperature:</u></b> Depending on your stove, these ranges could be accurate, or 

                <span title="Bijous house has an electric stove similar to our college apartment and it cooks things at a much lower temperature than the apartment.">COMPLETELY WRONG</span>, 

                so take this advice with a grain of salt:
            </p>
            <ul class="terms">
                <li><b>Word Range:</b> low ... medium ... high</li>
                <li><b>Numeric Range:</b> 1-2 ... 5-6 ... 9-10</li>
            </ul>
