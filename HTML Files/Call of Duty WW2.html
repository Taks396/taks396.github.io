      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Because you're weird and looked very intently at my site for all the hidden fun things, here is your reward; a detailed explanation on how I play Call of Duty: WW2 - Nazi Zombies. There is literally nothing about the base game that can't be explained in three seconds, and since I mostly play zombies anyway, this is the part I can explain how to do.</p>

      <h2>Early Game</h2>
      <p>Lets assume for a moment that you've never played a Call of Duty: Zombies game before, what're you supposed to do? The idea is you spawn in, shoot the shit out of zombies, and gather money from their corpses to buy guns, doors, and upgrades in the world. Since this specific game is WW2 themed, all of these are based around German words or weapons used at the time. After you kill enough zombies, the wave will end, giving you some breathing time, and the next begins with stronger base zombies, and later on stronger zombie types. Your main objective: Defeat the Panzerm√∂rder, but you don't know that just yet.</p>

      <p>Right now, you need money. The most efficient way to get money early on is by shooting zombies in the legs just enough to keep them alive, then finishing them off with your shovel. The weakest pistol available to you is the best way to do this and will let you shoot a zombie three times in the legs during round one. Four during round two and more during later waves. Do this until you run out of pistol ammo or until it takes more than one magazine to sufficiently damage a zombie where it can be meleed.</p>
