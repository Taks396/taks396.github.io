                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    Congratulations? You discovered a hidden page that talks about how to play my favorite first person shooter game, Call of Duty: WWII. Now, I'm not gonna tell you 

                    <span title="My advice would suck anyway because I am not good at shooters and mostly play to unwind.">how to play the campaign or typical multiplayer,</span> 
                    
                    because those arent why I enjoy this game. Instead, I am going to tell you how I play the Nazi Zombies gamemode and how to beat the main questline on The Final Reich map in the process. In addition, the advice I provide will tell you how to beat that questline in 
                    
                    <span title="There's apparently a world record for 12 rounds, but I am certain it requires luck as I've never been able to replicate it even following tutorials.">under 20 rounds.</span> 

                    I do not own any of the other maps at the time of writing, but will update this page if I ever decide to buy them as they are part of DLC content.

                <h2>Useful Terminology</h2>
                <ul class="terms">
                    <li><b>Main Loop: </b>How I refer to the two main regions on the map which connect at two gateways to create a "loop" like a race track.</li>
                    <li><b>Jolt: </b>The primary currency in this game, collected by completing some tasks and damaging/killing zombies.</li>
                    <li><b>Geistschild: </b>Called "Shield" in this tutorial and refers to the glowing, human sized, door-like objects placed up against walls.</li>
                    <li><b>Pest: </b>The fast, thin, burnt to a crisp zombies that spawn from the pilot light and every 5 rounds en masse.</li>
                    <li><b><span title="These guys are just like me!">Wüstling: </span></b>The large pale zombies with a spiked cage wrapped around their arm. They are easily damaged in the spine.</li>
                    <li><b>Brenner: </b>The LARGE flamethrower zombies that are just as fast as Pests. They do massive damage if they get close and take less damage if their flamethrower is intact.</li>
                    <li><b><span title="Fun Fact: This means tank murderer, which makes sense because it derails a train and is a pain to kill.">Panzermörder: </span></b>AKA Panzy, is the ultimate boss of this questline. Giant zombie constructed of many smaller zombies and steel. You'll know it when you see it.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Entering the Bunker</h2>
                <p>This is your first main goal outside of the starting area. To get here, shoot zombies in the leg three times then melee them with the shovel. I suggest keeping two zombies alive as they will be slower than keeping the last one only. Once you have enough jolts to leave, you'll need to find and open the bunker door. It is located behind the pilot light and requires power and 1250 Jolts to open. To power it, locate three gas valves which feed into a gas tank sitting beside the pilot light. Follow the tubes on the ground to find the valves themselves, one of which is behind a second gate costing 1000 Jolts. Since you kept two zombies alive, you don't have the Jolts to do this yet. Run around and run into different interactable items to provoke the chance that a zombie will spawn directly in front of you. Do this until you have enough Jolts to open the second gate.</p>

                <p>Once you've opened all three valves, return to the pilot light and ignite it, spawning several Pests. Kill them with your shovel for maximum Jolts as you need the money for the bunker. It might be impossible to do this, but try to keep the normal zombies from catching fire in the process as they are weak enough to die and you may need to farm some more to unlock the bunker door itself.</p>
