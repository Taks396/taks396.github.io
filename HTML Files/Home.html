                The purpose of this site is to catalog the various projects I work on over the years. This can range from cooking recipes to hobbies or stuff I've learned and will be grouped accordingly. No matter how small the project, I intend to document it so that myself or anyone who is interested can see what I have done and how it was done so that it can be replicated in the future.

				Furthermore, this is not supposed to be a professional site, more like a blog. The writing here is meant to be more akin to how I talk to people (and myself honestly) rather than a robotic tutorial on how to do everything I talk about. If you don't find this useful, you are welcome to provide feedback 

				<a title="Does anyone else hate how the default hyperlink color is blue? Really messes with my flow of formatting." href="#feedback"><b>here.</b></a>

				There will also be a <span title="See? Trying to make this blog as easy to use as possible!">link</span> at the bottom of every page routing you back here to provide feedback if it comes up.

				Occasionally I will mention of a person I call Bijou. This is my girlfriend. She may be mentioned to provide context for the stuff I talk about or show up as an avatar in different screenshots I take. Like me, you will not know her name or

				Last thing, throughout this website certain words, phrases, images and links have 
                
                <span title='I don&apos;t actually know what this little popup is called, but "hover text" seems appropriate.'>"hover text"
				</span> 
                
                attached to them. They are purposely hidden so that you can discover them, but in some cases they are more obvious because they are important for the section. This paragraph has a hidden example or two. 
                
                <span title="And don't cheat by looking at the HTML code in the sidebar. That defeats the fun!">Enjoy!</span>

            <p>GitHub Pages does not allow dynamic sites. As of this time, and until I can host my own site, this feature can't exist. Any of the people actually using this site already know me anyway, so honestly, just text me your feedback, and be nice about it.</p>
