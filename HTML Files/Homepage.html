    To test whether the redirect works, click this link: 
    <a href="../index.html">Go to Home</a><br>
    This tries to bring you back to the default index.html file that GitHub looks for to host the site. index.html automatically redirects you to this homepage on load 
    because I can't rename that file and still have the site work due to GitHubs dumb restrictions. This will work without breaking more than alternate methods
