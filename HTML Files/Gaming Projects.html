      <p>This page serves to show off the different things I have done in the different videogames I play. It won't contain anything that can't be explained simply, <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="Call of Duty WW2.html">like Call of Duty,</a> where the objective is just get in and shooty shooty, but instead will contain games that require some explanation, like how to build something for example.</p>

			<h3>Basic Gameplay</h3>
			<p>Ark is a very large game in terms of the amount of content available to the players, the size of the maps, and, much to the dismay of the playerbase, <span title="As of writing this, 120GB for the base game with no DLC content!">the size of the game install.</span> That being said, there exists a general game loop that applys on every single map regardless of whether you are playijng alone, with friends, or on a server. You have to survive the wilderness by establishing yourself somewhere on the map, progress through the tech tree to unlock useful items and tools, tame various dinosuars around the map, and ultimately beat the game by defeating the bosses located at key landmarks around the map. To progress, simply do things on the map, or just survive as the player will passively gain a <small title="Almost as tiny as Bijou!">tiny</small> amount of XP over time. To get a bit of a boost, around the map there are hidden containers like chests and vases that will give you a set amount of XP on collect and boost your XP gain by 4x for a time. After you get enough XP, you will level up and get the oppertunity to buff one of your <span title="Health - Stamina - Oxygen - Food - Water - Weight - Melee Damage - Movement Speed - Crafting Skill - Fortitude">stats</span>, which will then give you Engram Points that are spent in the tech tree for crafting recipes.</p>

			<p>Unlike many survival games, Ark <i>technically</i> cannot be played alone. An individual players level is capped and the number of Engram Points you gain across all levels combined is not enough to unlock every item in the tech tree. This is done to encourage players to engage with another core feature of the game: tribes. Whether with your friends or on a server, the player can join or lead a tribe and work with other players to complete the aformentioned goals. Even if you decide to play alone, the game compells you not to do everything alone by throwing hundreds of dinosuars at you, all of which have traits that the player can do, but they do it much better. Rexes do massive damage, Anklyos harvest tons of metal, Argentavis' can <span title="Yes the player technically can't fly but they get access to jetpacks and parachutes so this comparison counts.">fly</span>, etc. Some maps will have special dinos custom to the unique quirks of that map, but in general, you can <i>technically</i> do everything alone, but god help you if you do.</p>

			<p>And that's it. Because it's a survival game, Ark is very straightforward when it comes to what the players have to do to win, if they decide to beat the game at all. Otherwise, you can build the home of your dreams, tame and breed every dino, and conquer the map however they see fit without ever having to fight the bosses. Below is a tutorial on how to beat every map, starting from the first one: The Island.</p>
