                <p title="I am aware that the site will look very basic, but I like the default look of HTML. It is not overly complicated and makes me feel organized.">
				The purpose of this site is to catalog the various projects I work on over the years. This can range from cooking recipes to hobbies or stuff I've learned and will be grouped accordingly. No matter how small the project, I intend to document it so that myself or anyone who is interested can see what I have done and how it was done so that it can be replicated in the future.
			    </p>

                <p>
				Furthermore, this is not supposed to be a professional site, more like a blog. The writing here is meant to be more akin to how I talk to people (and myself honestly) rather than a robotic tutorial on how to do everything I talk about. If you don't find this useful, you are welcome to provide feedback
				<a style="font-weight: bold;" title="Does anyone else hate how the default hyperlink color is blue? Really messes with my flow of formatting." href="#feedback">here.</a>
				There will also be a <span title="See? Trying to make this blog as easy to use as possible!">link</span> at the bottom of every page routing you back here to provide feedback if it comes up. 
			    </p>

                <p>
				Occasionally there will also be mention of a person I call Bijou. This is my girlfriend. She may be mentioned to provide context for the stuff I talk about or show up as an avatar in different screenshots I take. Like me, you will not know her name or 
				<span title="Unfortunate for you as she's drop dead gorgeous, but I will not compromise her identity.">see her face.</span>
			    </p>

			    <p>
				Last thing, throughout this website certain words, phrases, images and links have <span title='I don't actually know what this little popup is called, but "hover text" seems appropriate.'>"hover text"
				</span> attached to them. They are purposely left unobvious so that you can discover them. This paragraph has an example or two. <span title="And don't cheat by looking at the HTML code in the sidebar. That defeats the fun!">Enjoy!</span>

    			<p>Please keep it civil. I will fix any problems with the site if they are pointed out. You can also request features, but it might take time if I agree with the idea.<br><br>I don't know what I am doing, but thats the point of this blog; to learn and document what I learn.</p>
