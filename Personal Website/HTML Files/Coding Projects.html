			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>This page is dedicated to all the projects I have coded over the years in my personal time, including this very website. The languages used range from high level languages like Python and Java to low level ones like Assembly. Since this is meant to be a tutorial style site, the first section will explain how I learn to program in any language before doing anything specific.</p>

			<h2>Languages</h2>
			<p>You can skip my spiel about learning to program if you're already experienced.</p>

			<h2>Learning How to Code</h2>
			<p>Ok, to start, you need to understand that I am not an expert programmer as of writing this site, so if you are experienced and are currently reading this, feel free to laugh at my poor advice. I've used sites like W3Schools, StackExchange, GeeksforGeeks, and constant googling to teach myself how to do all the things I describe below, so the number one thing you need to know is DO YOUR RESEARCH!</p>
			<p>That being said, here are some of the things I have picked up along the way:</p>
