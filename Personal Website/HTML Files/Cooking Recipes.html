			<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Alfredo Pasta:</h2><br>
			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p>
				At home, my family never cooked alfredo pasta. Always spaghetti, which don't get me wrong tastes great, but never alfredo pasta. That was always reserved for going out to eat at resturaunts. In college, I wanted to change that, but since I was a poor college student, I couldn't exactly 
				
				<span title="Olive garden serves the best alfredo pasta. Fight me!">go out to eat</span>
				
				often. Hence, homemade alfredo pasta!
			</p>

			<h3 id="alfredopasta">Alfredo Pasta: Ingredients</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><span title="I made this recipe with many different noodles depending on what I had available."><b>4oz</b> Pasta Noodles</span></li>
				<li><span title="Salted or unstalted it doesn't matter."><b>1 Tbsp</b> Butter</span></li>
				<li><span title="Minced means finely chopped. Think smaller than a pea but larger than sand grains."><b>2 cloves</b> Minced Garlic</span> or <span title="Use this if you don't want to chop garlic."><b>2-3 Tbsps</b> Garlic Powder</span></li>
				<li><b>1 Tbsp</b> Onion Powder</li>
				<span title="I found half milk and half cream works better than the 3:2 ratio many recipes suggest.">
					<li><b>1/2 cups</b> Milk</li>
					<li><b>1/2 cups</b> Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
				</span>
				<li><b>1 cup</b> Parmesan Cheese</li>
				<span title="To taste is incredibly annoying I agree, but after you cook long enough you eventually learn to just eyeball it.">
					<li><b>1/4 tsp</b> Salt or to taste</li>
					<li><b>1/4 tsp</b> Pepper or to taste</li>
				</span>
				<li><span title="Optional. Just the leaves squeezed into a ball a bit smaller than a grape."><b>2 Tbsps</b> Finely Chopped Parsley</span></li>
			</ul>

			<p>This should serve 1-2 people if I did the math right. My original recipe is the same but the numbers are slightly bigger to account for some leftovers and the existance of Bijou.</p>

			<h3>Instructions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Boil noodles in a pot of water on high heat. Some sites will say boil before adding the noodles, but I find it doesn't matter as long as your checking how soft they are once it does start boiling. Drain the water once the noodles are <span title="Use a wooden spoon or something to grab a noodle and squish it a bit. Boil longer until satisfied. The box probably tells you how long it should take.">soft to your liking.</span></li>
				<li>At the same time, heat your butter in a sauce pan over medium heat until it starts bubbling.</li>
				<li><span title="If your using garlic powder, wait until the next step to add that.">Add the minced garlic</span> to the bubbly butter and mix around until golden brown or it smells garlicy. Should be about 30 seconds.</li>
				<li>Add milk and cream into the saucepan. If you didnt add garlic earlier, add your garlic powder now. <span title="Bubbling but not bubbling heavily. If it starts rising, remove it from the heat quickly because clearly you weren't stirring enough!">Mix until simmering.</span></li>
				<li>Reduce to low heat. Add the onion powder, salt, pepper, and parmesan cheese. Mix until the cheese melts and the sauce is a bit thicker than before.</li>
				<li>Remove from heat and dump drained noodles into the sauce and mix. If your saucepan isnt big enough, pour the sauce and the noodles into a different bigger bowl.</li>
				<li>Add parsely as garnish if you have it and serve.</li>

			<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Alfredo Pizza:</h2><br>
			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p>
				So this one is funny. I made a deal with Bijou sometime near the end of college that if I could make a pizza, only then could I call myself a 
				
				<span title="I'm still not a chef, but don't tell Bijou that!">chef.</span> 
				
				Well that came back to bite me and I ended up makeing a really good alfredo pizza. Why alfredo? Dominos Pizza sells the best pizza in my opinion and my favorite from them is a three meat pizza with alfredo sauce instead of standard tomatoe sauce.
			</p>

			<h3 id="alfredopizza">Alfredo Pizza: Ingredients</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><span title="You can make this yourself if you want, but you can just buy the right size ball from the grocery store."><b>1 ball</b> Pizza Dough</span></li>
				<li><b>3/4 cups</b> <span title="I used the exact same sauce as in the alfredo pasta so click here to jump to that recipe."><a href="#alfredopasta">Alfredo Sauce</a></span></li>
				<li><b>8oz</b> Low Moisture Mozzarella Cheese</li>
				<li><b>1.5 Tbsps</b> <span title="You can also use green onions cut up into tiny pieces.">Sliced Chives</span></li>
				<li><span title="Optional">Sliced Pepperoni</span></li>
				<span title="I'm not putting amounts for these because they're very small and only relavent if you're using store bought dough.">
					<li>Olive Oil and Flour</li>
					<li>Salt to taste</li>
				</span>
			</ul>

			<p>This will produce a pizza about the same size as a Dominos medium pizza and can be cut into 4-6 slices, but only feeds 2-3 people depending on if you made a side dish.</p>

			<h3>Instructions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Prepare your dough!</b> If you're making your own, you're on your own here. If you're using store bought dough, follow the instructions on the back to let the dough rise. Mine says to keep it out of the fridge for 4 hours, then let it sit in a light sprinkling of olive oil for 8 hours.</li>
				<li>Preheat oven to 500F (260C). Roll your dough around in some flour then spread it over a pizza baking tray or a normal baking tray. <span title="If you struggle with this, that's ok. I did too and since I don't make this very often, I still do.">Keep enough dough near the edges to make a really flat bowl.</span></li>
				<li>Add your <span title="If you made your own, you might want to cook this ahead of time to let it thicken while you work the dough.">homemade</span> or store bought alfredo sauce and evently spread over your dough bowl.</li>
				<li>Pour on your mozzarella cheese and spread evenly. Lightly salt the pizza.</li>
				<li><span title="You can skip this step if you want or substitute in any meat of your choosing.">Add a layer of pepperoni slices.</span></li>
				<li>Move the pizza tray into the oven until the cheese is bubbling (10-15 minutes). Some ovens heat unevenly, so I rotate the pizza after about 8 minutes to try to keep the crust evenly cooked.</li>
				<li>Remove from oven and add your <span title="Or green onion bits in my case">chives</span> as garnish.</li>
				<li>This ones obvious, but cut it up into slices to serve each person 1-2 each. Enjoy!</li>

			<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Stovetop Burgers:</h2><br>
			<h3>Background</h3>
			<p>
				Again, my family rarely cooked burgers, and when we did they were awesome, so it annoyed me that we'd do it 
				
				<span title="Father also went on a diet so we couldn't eat a lot of foods like this, but that doesn't mean I wasn't disappointed!">so infrequently. </span>
				
				When I moved out for college, I wanted to change that, but also 
				
				<span title="One of my friends also set fire to the grill at my appartment well after I first made this recipe, further diswading me from using one.">didn't know how to use a grill. </span>

				THerefore, stovetop cooked burgers! They end up tasting incredible, but I have never managed to not set off my smoke alarm. Be warned!

			<h3>Instructions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Prep your bun and toppings. The burgers will come right off the pan and onto a bun, so you will want the toppings to be ready to assemble.</li>
