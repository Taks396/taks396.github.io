# Personal Website:

## Details:
This is the home directory for my personal website. Each of the directories contains a README.md that explains each in detail, but here is a quick summary of them:

- HTML Files contains the sites various pages in HTML format
- CSS Styles contains the sites appearance code so that it doesn't clog up the HTML code
- Site Images contains all the pictures used on the site
- Scripts contains javascript files used to make certain dynamic features of this page possible
- index.html is the default html file that GitHub uses to host websites. It serves as a redirect file and has no other purpose
