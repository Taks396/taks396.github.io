## Details:
This is the home directory for my personal website. Each of the directories contains a README.md that explains each in detail, but here is a quick summary of them:

- HTML Files contains the sites various pages in HTML format
- CSS Styles contains the sites appearance code so that it doesnt clog up the HTML code
- Site Images contains all the pictures used on the site
- index.html is the default html file that GitHub uses to host websites. It serves as a redirect file and has no other purpose

## Note to Self/User:
If you are trying to look at the commit history for some reason, I messed up a lot of stuff developing this page initially. As of Merge #3 (which is actually only the second merge to main), I started developing a commit system to make progress tracking easier:
- All commits must name the affected files in the title AFTER what the commit did
- The extended description is not to contain what the commit does, but instead why the commit does what it does if needed
- All merges AFTER Merge #3 are to be numbered accordingly where Merge #3 is the reference point (#3 -> #4 -> #5 -> ...)
